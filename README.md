# DOM Assignment

This repository contains the completed assignment for practicing various DOM manipulation techniques in JavaScript. The assignment includes multiple projects demonstrating different event listeners and a counter application as described below.

## Projects Overview

### 1. Onclick
A project demonstrating the use of the `onclick` event listener.

### 2. Double Click
A project demonstrating the use of the `ondblclick` event listener.

### 3. Onmouseover
A project demonstrating the use of the `onmouseover` event listener.

### 4. Mouseout
A project demonstrating the use of the `onmouseout` event listener.

### 5. Onkeypress
A project demonstrating the use of the `onkeypress` event listener.

### 6. Keydown and Keyup
A project demonstrating the use of the `onkeydown` and `onkeyup` event listeners.

### Counter App
A simple counter application created using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The counter app includes three buttons:
- **Increment Button**: Increases the counter by 1 each time it is pressed.
- **Decrement Button**: Decreases the counter by 1 each time it is pressed.
- **Reset Button**: Resets the counter to 0.

The counter app demonstrates how to manipulate the DOM to update the display dynamically based on user interactions.

## How to Run the Projects

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/DOM-Assignment.git
   
2. Navigate to the project directory:
```sh
cd DOM-Assignment

3. Open the specific project folder (e.g., 1-onclick, 2-doubleclick, etc.) in your preferred code editor or directly open the index.html file in a web browser to see the project in action.

4. For the Counter App, navigate to the Counter App folder and open index.html in your web browser.
